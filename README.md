## Summary

**U5MR** stands for Under 5 Mortality Rate. Typically, an U5MR value describes the number of children who died before the age of Fife years. Children, especially at a young age, are the most vulnerable part of a society. Using the mortality rate at an age under five years, the wealth of a country or a continent can be described. In the past 20 years, the worldwide U5MR was halved. Most people think, that the world is getting worse but it is not. The goal is to show the global increase of wealth.

Tools & libraries used

* Python
* Plotly

## Dataset

UNdata provides multiple datasets with U5MR data.
[This](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=under+five+mortality&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a80) dataset contains five-year averaged data from 1950 to 2020 and projected data from 2020 to 2100. It is the biggest dataset and contains data of every country with more than 90'000 inhabitants (in 2019). Next to the countries, it also contains the worldwide average and averages of continents and regions.

Where UNdata got each values can be seen [here](https://population.un.org/wpp/DataSources/). The dataset was downloaded as `.csv`.

Because we do not know what will happen in the future, i have limited the used values to the historical values.


I was able to download the same dataset as an excel sheet `UnderFiveMortality5q0SustDevGroups.xlsx` grouped by regions from [here](https://population.un.org/PEPxplorer/api/queryweb/exportexcel). 
>Unfortunately, their website has changed and the data selector tool does not work anymore.
