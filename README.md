## Summary

**U5MR** stands for Under 5 Mortality Rate. Typically, an U5MR value describes the number of children who died before the age of Fife years. Children, especially at a young age, are the most vulnerable part of a society. Using the mortality rate at an age under five years, the wealth of a country or a continent can be described.
